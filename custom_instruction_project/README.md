🚀 Custom Instruction Simulation (MULADD) — Python Style!

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to one of the coolest and simplest compiler simulation projects ever. This one’s for beginners, made with love and logic.

🧠 Goal: Simulate a custom instruction using Python — because why not make math smarter?

💡 What’s the Big Idea?

Ever heard of the equation:

z = a * b + c

Normally, your CPU will do the multiplication and addition as two steps. But what if we combined them into one custom instruction?

🔧 Enter our superstar: MULADD — it does both in one go!

🧠 Meet the Custom Instruction: MULADD
🧠 What’s Happening in the Compiler (Behind the Scenes)
Let’s understand how this project simulates what a compiler does — and how it’s different from regular Python code.

🔹 What Normally Happens in Python
When you write:
z = a * b + c
Python does:

Multiply a * b

Add c

Store the result in z

✅ Easy to write
❌ But it takes two separate CPU instructions

🔹 What a Compiler Tries to Do
A compiler translates high-level code (like C/C++) into low-level machine instructions. It tries to optimize your code by:

Combining multiple steps

Using faster custom instructions

Real-world compilers may use a single instruction like MULADD to combine multiplication and addition in one go.

🧩 How Your Project Simulates This
Your Python function:

def muladd(a, b, c):
    return a * b + c
acts like a custom compiler instruction, doing both operations in one line.
So instead of:
Step 1: Multiply a * b  
Step 2: Add c
You're simulating:

Single Step: MULADD(a, b, c) → a * b + c
🤖 Why This Matters
This is exactly how real compilers optimize code — especially in performance-critical tasks like gaming, AI, or graphics. You’re simulating one small piece of that using beginner-friendly Python code!

🎯 Final Takeaway 
“Instead of writing separate steps for multiplication and addition, I created a custom instruction — like compilers do — and simulated it using a Python function. This helps show how compilers optimize programs to be faster and more efficient.”

Visual proof it works!

👀 Let’s Peek at the Code!

def muladd(a, b, c):
    return a * b + c

Just 1 line — that’s the heart of our custom instruction 💖

And here’s how we use it:

a = int(input("Enter a: "))
b = int(input("Enter b: "))
c = int(input("Enter c: "))
result = muladd(a, b, c)
print("Result using custom instruction (MULADD):", result)

Simple, fast, and clean. 🧼

🧪 Sample Output (Spoiler Alert!)

Enter a: 2
Enter b: 3
Enter c: 4
Result using custom instruction (MULADD): 10

Boom 💥 — it works just like that!
