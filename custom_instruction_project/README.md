# Custom Instruction Simulation in Python

This project simulates a fake compiler instruction called `MULADD`.

It does:  
z = a * b + c

## How to Run

1. Open terminal or command prompt.
2. Go to the folder where the file is.
3. Type:  
   python custom_instruction.py

4. Enter numbers like:  
   a = 2  
   b = 3  
   c = 4

5. It will show the result!

Now take a screenshot of the output and save it as: `output_screenshot.png`
