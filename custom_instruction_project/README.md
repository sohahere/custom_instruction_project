🚀 Custom Instruction Simulation (MULADD) — Python Style!

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to one of the coolest and simplest compiler simulation projects you’ll ever see. This one’s for beginners, made with love and logic.

🧠 Goal: Simulate a custom instruction using Python — because why not make math smarter?

💡 What’s the Big Idea?

Ever heard of the equation:

z = a * b + c

Normally, your CPU will do the multiplication and addition as two steps. But what if we combined them into one custom instruction?

🔧 Enter our superstar: MULADD — it does both in one go!

🧠 Meet the Custom Instruction: MULADD

Instruction Name: MULADD

Does This:

z = a * b + c

All in a single action

Like giving your calculator a turbo mode

Why? Because compilers in the real world optimize instructions to run faster — we’re simulating that!

Visual proof it works!

👀 Let’s Peek at the Code!

def muladd(a, b, c):
    return a * b + c

Just 1 line — that’s the heart of our custom instruction 💖

And here’s how we use it:

a = int(input("Enter a: "))
b = int(input("Enter b: "))
c = int(input("Enter c: "))
result = muladd(a, b, c)
print("Result using custom instruction (MULADD):", result)

Simple, fast, clean. 🧼

🧪 Sample Output (Spoiler Alert!)

Enter a: 2
Enter b: 3
Enter c: 4
Result using custom instruction (MULADD): 10

Boom 💥 — it works just like that!

🙌 Thank You for Checking It Out!

Hope this helped you understand how a compiler might think! 🤖

Feel free to try it, remix it, break it (and fix it!) — just like real developers do 💻
